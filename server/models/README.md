The `/models` folder contains all database models for the application. The model is a set of Typescript declarations and functions to query the database for these types of objects.

Rules of thumb:
 * A file in the `/models` folder should match a table with the same name in the database.
 * SQL code is not allowed anywhere but in the `/models` folder.
